1. UIKit creates a brand-new scene session.
2. And let's you specify a configuration for it, by calling `configurationForConnectingSceneSession` 
- You can inspect the user activity which is given back to you now through the UI scene connecting options, to pick a session

`sceneWillConnectToSession:`

you are able to find your user activity and the connecting options, configure a window and view controller hierarchy for it.

`sceneWillConnectToSession:` 

If the session is still existing, we go straight to the scene delegate.

If the session had been disconnected in the meantime.

## Refresh

**Refresh a session for user-relevant updates**

### Session Refresh

- Updates to shared data
- New user-relevant data
- Session and scene hygiene

- State restoration user activity
- Scene Activation conditions
- Session UI and switcher snapshot

If the scene is still connected, either in the foreground or the background, it can listen to the notification itself and call the API, which is going to do the right thing internally.

If the scene has been disconnected, the view controller won't be there anymore. And so, the long-libed object can step in, figure that out and call to refresh API in its place. The scene is goint then to be background connected and the view controller will have a chance to update itself and snapshot will be captured.
